# Axiom — UI Logic Repository

> Treat every decision as a repeatable system. Break the rule only after you understand it.

The decision engine behind sharp, consistent interfaces. This repository captures the micro-decisions that define durable design systems across typography, layout, color, and interaction patterns.

## What is Axiom?

Axiom is a reference-ready collection of product UI best practices structured as design axioms—fundamental truths that don't require proof, just application. Each decision includes:

- ✅ Do/Don't patterns
- 🎯 Context tags (Buttons, Forms, Accessibility, etc.)
- 📐 Specific values and formulas
- 🧠 Conceptual grounding (Gestalt, Fitts's Law, etc.)

## Coverage

- **38 curated decisions** grounded in product UI best practices
- **6 system categories**: Typography, Layout, Color, Components, Forms, System Logic
- **Fast scanning** with tag filters and encoded patterns

## Why Axiom?

Stop debating the same design decisions on every project. Axiom codifies battle-tested heuristics so teams can:

- Ship faster with consistent patterns
- Onboard designers with clear principles
- Reduce decision fatigue
- Build accessible, readable interfaces by default

## Structure

Each axiom follows a consistent format:
- **Title**: The principle (e.g., "Sentence Case is King")
- **Tags**: Context/domains it applies to
- **Rule**: The specific guideline
- **Do/Avoid**: Visual comparison with values
- **Deep dive**: Extended rationale and edge cases

---

**Built for consistency. Break rules only after mastering them.**
